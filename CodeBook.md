#####TRANSFORMATIONS OR WORK

######Description of Work below. See "run_analysis.R" and/or "README.md" for full R script

* Read Activity Data Labels from "activity_labels.txt" file as character strings
* Read Measurement data variables names from "features.txt" as character strings
* Create Descriptive Variable Names for each measurement summary
	* Start by creating a vector copy of original measurement variables names
	* Replace cryptic variable name parts with more descriptive parts
	* Add descriptive Labels to Data measurement Label Dataframe and keep as characters (not factors)
	* Create a vector of training variables with mean/Mean and standard deviation only
	* Add subject and activity variable names to training variables to keep
* Read-in Training Data
	* Read Training Type ID for each Activity recored in "X_train.txt" from "Y_train.txt" in "train" folder cast as numeric variables
	* Read Subject ID for each Activity recorded in "X_train.txt" from "subject_train.txt" in "train" folder cast as numeric variables
	* Read activity measurement data from "X_train.txt" in "train" folder using variable headings from measurementLabels third (descriptive) column
	* Combine Subject ID variable, Training Type ID and Description variable and measurement data variables
* Read-in Test Data
	* Read Training Type ID for each Activity recored in "X_test.txt" from "Y_test.txt" in "test" folder cast as numeric variables
	* Add a column to testType of the description of training from activityDataLabels
	* Read Subject ID for each Activity recorded in "X_test.txt" from "subject_test.txt" in "test" folder cast as numeric variables
	* Read activity measurement data from "X_test.txt" in "test" folder using variable headings from measurementLabels  third (descriptive) column
	* Combine Subject ID variable, Test Type ID and Description variable and measurement data variables
	* Combine training activity data and test activity data into activityData
*Subset activityData with only subject, activity and mean/Mean/std measurements
* Create Summary by Subject
	* Split Activity Data into a list of dataframes by Subject number
	* Create matrix of column means for each data frame in list of activity data by subject
	* Transpose matrix of column means to put variables in columns, subjects in rows
	* Remove column of means of Traning IDs as nonsense data
	* Convert matrix of measurement means for each subjct to data frame
* Create Summary by Activity
	* Split Activity Data into a list of dataframes by Activity
	* Create matrix of column means for each data frame in list of activity data by activity
	* Transpose matrix of column means to put variables in columns, activities in rows
	* Remove column of means of Subject numbers as nonsense data, Also remove TrainingIDs as we want Descriptive Training Types
	* Add Training Types as first column, also converts to data.frame, Yea!
* Write Mean data of columns summary by subject and activity to files
