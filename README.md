* ==================================================================
* Partial Summary of Human Activity Measurements from Samsung Galaxy S II. 
* Original data from source listed at the bottom of this file.
* ==================================================================

The data summarization takes measurement, matches them up with the subject (person) wearing the S II
and the activity they were performing. It then takes averages of the average and standard deviation
data supplied separately for each subject and separately for each activity.

###The dataset includes the following files:

* 'README.txt' :                     This file
* 'CodeBook.md':                     A file containing a list of the variables and descriptions, input and output files and methods of data manipulation
* 'run_analysis.R':                  R Script for making the tidy data
* 'ActivityMeasurementDataMean.txt': Output data - means of mean and stardard deviation data by activity
* 'SubjectMeasurementDataMean.txt' : Output data - means of mean and stardard deviation data by subject
